# Social_Book-Java
This is a supposed social media that includes Users and Groups and it can help to find infected people in a pandemic period. 
There are Users who have a list of friends. Also, two types of groups. The first type is the open group in which everyone can be member,
and the closed group in which users can be members only if they have a friend who is member. The main purpose of the program is to show the people
who have to be tested when a user has been infected (his/her friends and their friends).
